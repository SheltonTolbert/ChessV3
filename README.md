# Quick start

Create a new Unity project called "ChessV3" (Unity Version 2019.4.8 - but I don't think that really matters)

Download the files in this repoository and drag them to the "ChesV3/" folder (this will replace the Assets folder)

Open this repository Github Desktop and select "Locate Repository"

Select the "ChessV3" folder
